You know the index in a back of a book that shows all the occurences of a given topic? Well I created something like that, but for sets of videos. You create timestamps for videos and use hashtags to categorize them. Then you can list all the timestamps that contain a given hashtag. Then you can click on the timestamp to instantly jump to that time, at that video.
